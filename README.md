# CyberQuest Defender

CyberQuest Defender is a 2D interactive web app developed during the 24-hour **Hermes Hackathon 2024**, where the theme was _Cybersecurity meets Retro Gaming_. Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this application showcases retro aesthetics and combines fun with practical tools.

## Features

Navigate a small top-view 2D map and interact with three unique NPCs:

1. **Phishing Checker**: Input URLs to check for potential phishing threats.
2. **Pixel Generator**: Upload an image and transform it into a pixelated retro-style version.
3. **Breach Email Checker**: Enter your email to verify if it has been part of any data breaches.

### Note on APIs

The three NPCs utilize free APIs for their respective functionalities:

- The **Phishing Checker** requires a valid API key to function properly. Users need to upload their API key for this feature.
- The **Pixel Generator** and **Breach Email Checker** rely on public APIs that work without additional configuration.

## How It Works

- Use your keyboard to control the character and move around the map.
- Approach NPCs to interact with their specific tools.
- Enjoy a retro game-inspired environment while learning and applying cybersecurity knowledge.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure and content of the web app.
- **CSS**: Styling, including the retro design and character animations.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for character movement, NPC interactions, and tool functionality.
